# Stuff I Did Today, the Log #

## 1/13/19, Sunday ##
This was a low energy day. I worked my regular shift (4am - 1:30pm) in the morning. I spent some time designing a layout for my Nordstrom hackathon project that I'll be doing on Tuesday. In the evening I did this week's Lambda School Javascript challenges on repl.it.
