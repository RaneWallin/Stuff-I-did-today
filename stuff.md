# Stuff I Did Today, the Log #

## 1/13/19, Sunday ##
This was a low energy day. I worked my regular shift (4am - 1:30pm) in the morning. I spent some time designing a layout for my Nordstrom hackathon project that I'll be doing on Tuesday. In the evening I did this week's Lambda School Javascript challenges on repl.it.

 Another light day, coing wise. The Nordstrom hackathon starts tomorrow. Had some project discussions with my team. Lambda School is on a free day, so not much to do there. Went over Sprint Challenge with PM.

Today was the final day of the Nordstrom hackathon. My team made a web app using React, Redux and Firebase. I was responsibile for setting up and integrating Firebase. My teammates worked on setting up the front end and UI. 

We got the finishing touches on today and the app worked mostly like I imagined. Google was offering a side competition for people who used Google Cloud Services in their app. We ended up winning that competition!
