# Stuff I Did Today, the Log #

## 1/13/19, Sunday ##
This was a low energy day. I worked my regular shift (4am - 1:30pm) in the morning. I spent some time designing a layout for my Nordstrom hackathon project that I'll be doing on Tuesday. In the evening I did this week's Lambda School Javascript challenges on repl.it.

 Another light day, coing wise. The Nordstrom hackathon starts tomorrow. Had some project discussions with my team. Lambda School is on a free day, so not much to do there. Went over Sprint Challenge with PM.
